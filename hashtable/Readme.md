# Hash tables 
Hash tables are a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function

# challenge 
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

set
Arguments: key, value

Returns: nothing

get
Arguments: key

Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

contains
Arguments: key

Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

keys
Returns: Collection of keys

hash
Arguments: key

Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency
 time complexity 0(1)  space complexity O(0)



## API
hash (key):return the hash value of an object
set (key,value):it used to add key and value to the hash table
get (key):to get the value of inputed key if it exists in hashtable
contains (key) "to make sure if key exists in hashtable
keys :return a collection of keys
